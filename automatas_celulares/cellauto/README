To build, just do a 'make'

To run, just do a './cellauto', it will prompt you with a usage message telling you
about the appropriate command line parameters

When run correctly, the program will return a raw ppm file.  These are uncompressed 
images which are rather large.  You can very easily convert these images on the fly 
utilizing a variety of image conversion utilities.  For example, if you have the 
Image Magic packages you can do a

./cellauto 18 800 600 1 0 | convert pgm:- png:MyNewImageFile.png
or
./cellauto 18 800 600 1 0 | cjpeg > MyNewImageFile.jpg

Please let me know if you have any issues, suggestions or bug-fixes
